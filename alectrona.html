            <h1>Goal</h1>
            <p>
            The objective of this project was to create an application that enables users to create music effortlessly on their iPad device.
            The project required building a flexible design system suitable for both this project and future adaptations.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the sole Graphic Designer, I was responsible for creating all icons, buttons, and components, as well as create themes for user's to select, 
            that would transform the appearance of the interface. 
            These themes were essential for fostering user engagement by enabling the app to align with personal identities, encouraging more frequent usage. 
            I specifically aimed to appeal to traditional demographics while also addressing groups often overlooked in the music technology market.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <h1>Challenges</h1>
                <li>Design elements must maintain scalability and flexibility across all implementations</li>
                <li>Develop themes that connect with users on a personal level</li>
                <li>Create original custom icons from scratch for all interface buttons</li>
                <li>Customize buttons specifically for each theme while maintaining functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Components</h1>
            <p>
                In order to design icons that would be recognizable and familiar to users, I looked at interfaces for pre-existing electonic
                insturments. An essential part of my research was a book by the name of <i>"PUSH TURN MOVE: Interface design in electronic music"</i> by
                Kim Bjorn. I analyzed dozens of images of music interfaces and the visual look of the buttons, sliders and knobs so that they
                could be recreated for this project. For some of the themes, the goal was realism, others minimalism.

            <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
            <p>
                I started with a mobile-first approach for scalable designs across devices. The most important features I needed to 
                include were: <u>a prominent contact button and a hero message.</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                Initially planning light/dark mode with a toggle. To create a tech-focused aesthetic, I selected fonts that reinforced 
                this vision. The high-contrast combination of neon colors against a black background evoked a 
                programming environment. I ultimately committed to a dark mode-only design as it best served 
                the concept.
                The BOOK CALL button required prominent homepage placement.

                With the layouts esablished, I created polished designs for each page, and included content so the final 
                product can be fully visualized and easily developed. Each page features unique layouts and destinctive graphic design 
                elements. My personal favorite is the case studies, because the hero image creates an 
                eyecatching design that shines brilliantly in contrast to the black background.
                All pages can be accessed at any time through the navigation bar and the footer.

            <p>
                Protential Clients can reach out from multiple locations on the website: the footer, the homepage, and the navigation 
                bar to ensure no missed opportunities. Similarly, social media links are strategically positioned in these same locations, 
                making it easy for website viewers to connect across all platforms.

                This was a very exciting opportunity as a new designer. I deeply enjoy creatting unconventional designs,
                especially for websites, and having full creative control of the entire project made it especially meaningful. I am very 
                satisfied with the final product and thoroughly enjoyed the entire process from beginning to end.
